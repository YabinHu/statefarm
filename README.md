# Starter nolearn/lasagne code for Kaggle's State Farm competition

## Introduction

This repository should help you getting started with the [State Farm Distracted Driver Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/c/state-farm-distracted-driver-detection) competition. It uses [nolearn](https://github.com/dnouri/nolearn) and [Lasagne](https://github.com/Lasagne/Lasagne) for the neural network part.

A notebook with an example run can be found [here](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ottogroup/statefarm/blob/master/statefarm_getting_started.ipynb). On local CV, it reaches a log loss of < 0.9 when splitting on drivers.

## Requirements

You should install the following packages:

* ipython-notebook
* pandas
* scikit-learn
* scikit-image
* scipy
* matplotlib
* nolearn

Our code ran with Python 3.4
